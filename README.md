## üöÄ About the Project
I stepped into the role of a **Data Analyst** for Swiggy, built a **Snowflake-inspired normalized schema**, and solved **20 advanced business problems** using PostgreSQL to help drive data-driven decisions in marketing, operations, and product strategy.

## üßä Schema Design
Built using best practices of a Snowflake-inspired schema (high normalization):
